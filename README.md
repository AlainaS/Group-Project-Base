Visualizations: This project uses a simple bar chart from Charts.js which counts the number of people in common between 2 films. The x axis on the bar graph tracks the department these people worked in, while the y axis tracks how many people were in each specific department.

Description of project: Coffee and Cereal was created as a way to give recognition to more people in the film industry. Often times, we only really acknowledge the leading actors and the main writers/directors/producers. In reality, tons of departments are behind the art of film making. If you enter two different films, you can see many in the film industry have different projects. You may notice similarities behind the cinematography, the visual and sound effects, and so on in two completely different films. Let's say you really loved the visual effects of Avengers: Endgame and Pacific Rim. Well, you could enter those movies in and see just how many people were in common in the visual effects department for these movies! There are endless possibilities. We hope you have fun with it!

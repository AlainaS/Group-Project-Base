<h1>The Project:</h1>
<p>Coffee and Cereal is a webpage which uses IMDB's API. The user enters in two different films/TV shows and shows the cast/crew in common.</p>
<p>Often times, people ignore film credits because they're boring to look at or time consuming. This visualization we have categorizes the different departments in film making, and shows the number of common people in each department. </p>
<p>The goal of this project is to display careers of people in the film industry.  You could enter two different films which were made 20 years apart and you will likely find some crew in common between both films.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy our web page, and think of all the hard work people put into the art of film making!</p>
